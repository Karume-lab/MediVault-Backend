     ```

     Restart your terminal and then run:

     ```

     Check the node version being used:

     ```bash
     DFX_VERSION=0.16.1 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
     ```

     Check the installation:

     ```bash
     dfx --version
     ```

     If encountering "dfx: command not found," add $HOME/bin to your path. Example:

     ```bash
     echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"' >> "$HOME/.bashrc"
     ```
